# Assignment 1
# Project domains

## Overview
This document outlines ten possible **domains** for exploration in my project. The bold domains are the ones I ended up choosing for further exploration.

## **1. Personal healthcare management: handling everyday health routines and medicines**
My grandma has suffered from Parkinsons disease for the past 14 years and takes over 12 medications each day. As such, I have noticed how complicated everyday health routines can get, both for me and for people I know. It is not just remembering to take a pill at the right time, but also keeping track of vitamins, prescriptions, and other habits like drinking enough water. Sometimes I wonder if two medicines or supplements I am taking might interact in a bad way, but I don’t have an easy way to check without digging through confusing articles online or long documentations. Also, after the Covid-19 lockdown mental health has started gaining more attention. I am especially interested in the intersection of psychology and art, so focusing on mental health could connect directly to my interests.

## 2. **Travel prep and exploration: supporting people in preparing for trips, managing logistics, and making the most of cultural experiences**
I really enjoy traveling, but I usually find the preparation and planning parts stressful, especially as a type A person. Packing is always a guessing game because of the weather in foreign countries, and I either bring too much or forget something important. Moreover, once I am at my destination, I want to make the most of my time, but it’s hard to balance between exploring and resting. I often just end up going to the most touristy places, but I feel like I am missing out on hidden gems. I find museums in particular to be overwhelming. I find myself wandering without a clear plan, and sometimes leave feeling like I missed the best parts.  I love learning about new cultures and history, so I always prioritize museums on my visits. People often find museums boring nowadays. I would like to make traveling feel lighter and more intentional, with tools that reduce decision fatigue and help me focus on the experiences I will genuinely enjoy.

## 3. Structured studying: helping learners organize, connect, and review material more effectively.

## 4. Early-career relationships: making it easy for young professionals to build and maintain professional connections.

## 5. Concerts and live events planning and memory: enhancing the way people plan, attend, and share experiences at live events

## 6. Shopping and product discovery: exploring items in a way that feels curated, simplified, and mall-like, whether online or in-person.

## 7. Social event planning: small-group events (game nights, study groups, hangouts) and the friction around coordinating them.

## **8. Reading the news: navigating information overload in the news**
I try to keep up with the news every day, usually through apps on my phone or scrolling headlines online. But it often feels overwhelming. I often notice the same story appears across multiple outlets, and I waste time figuring out what’s new versus what’s repetitive. It’s also hard to know which sources I can really trust, especially when articles have different spins on the same event. Sometimes I want deeper coverage of topics I care about, like tech or economics, but instead I get buried under clickbait and endless feeds. Other times, I do not have much time, and I just want a quick glimpse into the topics I mostly care about. I’m interested in this domain because staying informed is important, but the way news is presented today makes it stressful, time-consuming, and confusing.

## 9. Subleasing and student housing: simplifying the process of finding, offering, and managing short-term rentals.

## 10. Neighborhood connections and community life: rebuilding the sense of a friendly neighborhood by making it easier for people to connect, share resources, and support each other locally.
