# Stakeholders

## Mental health routines

1. **User**: the person trying to maintain habits like journaling, and to understand their emotions. The user might usually struggle with their mental health.
2. **Therapist**: psychologists, counselors, or therapists.
3. **Family/friends**: people close to the user, who are indirectly affected by the user’s mental health and consistency with self-care.

**Impact**

The user directly struggles with their mental health and with maintaining routines and may feel guilt or stress when they fall off track. They could benefit from an app that doesn’t replace therapists, but acts as a supportive tool for in-between appointments. Moreover, therapists could benefit if patients reinforce their progress between sessions, but they might worry about over-reliance on an app, or even being replaced by it. Finally, family and friends may see improved relationships and stability if the user feels more balanced. While the latter is not a direct impact, friends and family might feel less worried knowing their loved one is taking care of themself.

## Museum overwhelm

1. **Visitor**: the museum-goer using the app to log preferences and receive a curated set of exhibits tailored to their interests.
2. **Museum (institutions or marketers)**: organizations that want visitors to enjoy their experience, spend more time, and return; they may also want to highlight certain exhibits or events through the app.
3. **Friends/followers**: people who see the visitor’s logged highlights, or more generally, other users on the app.

**Impact**

The visitor directly benefits from avoiding overwhelm and making the most of their limited time, as well as finding museums tailored to what they like. Museums gain by improving visitor satisfaction and by having new channels to promote special exhibitions or under-visited galleries. Negative feedback could hurt them, though. They could also use the reviews gained through this to improve. It is essentially a new avenue for them to advertise. Friends/followers engage with the visitor’s taste feed, which spreads word-of-mouth recommendations and may encourage them to explore museums themselves. If a user sees that a friend has visited, they might even reach out to ask for further details.

## Information overload

1. **Reader**: the person using the app to read daily news.
2. **News outlets/publishers**: content providers whose articles are aggregated; they care about how their work is surfaced, summarized, and whether readers click through.
3. **Podcasters/media creators**: people whose work is recommended alongside articles.
4. **Society at large**: communities that benefit when more people are consistently informed rather than disengaged due to overload.

**Impact**

The reader gains by filtering repetitive headlines, saving time, and engaging at the depth that fits their availability. Publishers may gain exposure if their articles are surfaced well, but may worry about losing ad revenue if users only read summaries. They might also worry how their work is shortened and what the impact is to their writing. Podcasters/media creators stand to benefit from new listeners directed to their work. Finally, at a broader level, society benefits when citizens are better informed, strengthening civic awareness and participation.
