# Problem statement

## Problem domain: Travel prep and exploration
### supporting people in preparing for trips, managing logistics, and making the most of cultural experiences

I really enjoy traveling, but I usually find the preparation and planning parts stressful, especially as a type A person. Packing is always a guessing game because of the weather in foreign countries, and I either bring too much or forget something important. I often just end up going to the most touristy places, but I feel like I am missing out on hidden gems. I find museums in particular to be overwhelming. I love learning about new cultures and history, so I always prioritize museums on my visits. People often find museums boring nowadays. I would like to make traveling feel lighter and more intentional, with tools that reduce decision fatigue and help me focus on the experiences I will genuinely enjoy.

## Problem
### Museum overwhelm

Large museums have hundreds of exhibits, and visitors often lack the time or expertise to decide what to focus on. Maps and audio guides rarely adapt to personal interests. As a result, people wander aimlessly, miss highlights, or feel rushed and dissatisfied. This creates a sense of wasted opportunity, despite museums being some of the most culturally rich spaces. At the same time, because of the number of exhibits in a museum, people forget what they saw very soon after their visit. A more personalized way to discover museums could help visitors connect with what they truly care about and make cultural exploration more enjoyable.

## Stakeholder list

- Visitors: may feel stressed, rushed, or fatigued when faced with too many exhibits and no clear way to prioritize. Instead of leaving inspired, they often leave tired or disappointed, feeling they missed the highlights.
- Museums (institutions and marketers): indirectly affected by the problem. If visitors feel overwhelmed or disengaged, they are less likely to return, recommend the museum, or spend money on memberships and extras. This damages the museum’s reputation and financial health, even if the exhibits themselves are high quality.
- Friends/followers: also impacted because overwhelmed visitors share fewer meaningful highlights. Instead of authentic recommendations (“you must see this exhibit”), they might give vague feedback or avoid posting altogether. This reduces the natural word-of-mouth promotion that museums rely on.
- Artists/curators: The people designing exhibits or showcasing their work are affected if visitors don’t engage deeply. Overwhelm means that smaller or less famous pieces often get ignored, and curators’ efforts to tell a story across an exhibition may go unnoticed.

## Evidence and comparables

| Title | Explanation | Source/Comparable |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Engagement drops after 30 minutes** | A 2019 study published in *Visitor Studies* found museum-goers’ engagement and comprehension decline sharply after about 30 minutes. This shows visitors need help focusing on key exhibits before fatigue sets in. | [CN Traveller](https://www.cntravellerme.com/story/experts-reveal-the-surprising-reason-museums-and-galleries-make-you-feel-so-tired) |
| **Museum fatigue is real** | “Museum fatigue” is defined as physical or mental fatigue triggered by overwhelming exhibits. The term dates back to 1916 and has been confirmed in later experiments showing attention decline over time. This fact confirms museum fatigue is not anecdotal. In fact, it’s a well-documented, historically validated issue that museums and researchers have studied for over a century. | [Wikipedia: Museum fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_fatigue) |
| **Travelers spend excessive time planning** | A survey of 2,000 UK holidaymakers found travelers spend over 1 hour per day planning during trips, totaling 17 hours across two weeks. 29% reported feeling overwhelmed by choices, including cultural activities like museum visits. This fact demonstrates that trip planning is stressful and time-consuming. A solution like the one I propose could help address this.| [The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/27368710/brits-waste-hours-planning-holiday-loveholidays/) |
| **Real-world indecision on forums** | On Rick Steves and Reddit travel forums, visitors often debate which museums to prioritize (e.g., Van Gogh Museum vs Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), showing how difficult choices erode trip quality. It confirms people indeed struggle with choosing a museum to visit.| [Rick Steves Travel Forum](https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum) |
| **Comparable: Explorer (AMNH app)** | Offers exhibit recommendations based on pre-selected interests and sorts them by proximity in the museum. While it provides personalization, it’s static and doesn’t evolve from real-time user feedback, nor does it involve user’s friends. It also doesn’t apply to museum selection as a whole but rather exhibit selection. | [AMNH Explorer App](https://www.amnh.org/apps/explorer) |
| **Comparable: Smartify** |  lets users scan artworks to get information, save favorites, and curate collections (people call it “Shazam for art.”) On one hand, it enhances access to art information, but it lacks taste-driven recommendations or exhibit-level ratings. | [Smartify](https://smartify.org) |
