# Application pitch

## Name

### MuseMe

# Motivation

MuseMe solves museum fatigue by highlighting exhibits you’ll enjoy most and surfacing recommendations from people you trust.

## Features

Key features must target the user before the visit (which museum?), during the visit (which exhibits?), after the visit (share & memory):

- ### Taste-based museum recommendations (Name: Spotlight)
After rating museums with simple tags like “Love,” “Like,” or Meh,” users build a personal taste profile. MuseMe uses this to recommend museums tailored to their interests, locally or while traveling. Visitors avoid decision fatigue, and museums attract more engaged audiences.

- ### Exhibit diary & share (Name: Showcase)
Visitors can log photos and ratings of exhibits to create a visual diary. These highlights can be shared with friends, offering authentic recommendations. This boosts word-of-mouth discovery, gives users a fun record of their visit, and provides museums with organic promotion.

- ### “People like you” exhibit suggestions (Name: Curations)
Using collaborative filtering, MuseMe suggests exhibits enjoyed by people with similar tastes. This helps visitors uncover hidden gems they might otherwise miss, reduces “FOMO,” and spreads attention across more exhibits, giving smaller artists visibility and museums better visitor flow.
