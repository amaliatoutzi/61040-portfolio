## Problem & trigger
Maya is in Boston for a work trip and has one free afternoon. She likes contemporary sculpture but hates losing time wandering giant museums. She also has a flight to catch, so she does not want to waste time. The city has dozens of options. But a quick search leaves Maya more troubled as every website feels generic. She needs help answering two decisions fast: which museum? and, once there, which exhibits?

## 1. Picking a museum (Spotlight)
Maya decides to open MuseMe. On Spotlight (see Spotlight sketch), a short line says “Based on your taste…” with a stack of museum cards. A simple city filter narrows the list. One card stands out—Institue of Conteporary Art—because Spotlight notes it’s similar to places she marked LOVE earlier on past trips. She taps the card.

## 2. Deciding what to see (Curations + subtle social proof)
On Museum Subpage — Curations (see Museum Subpage sketch), the header gives a quick blurb, and the Suggested exhibits list ranks pieces by stars based on Maya's followers. Next to one exhibit, she notices a tiny friend cue: Emma ★★★★☆”—her best friend visited last month and liked it. That nudge reduces her uncertainty; she screenshots the card and texts Emma, “I’m here—any must-sees?” Emma replies with two favorites, which match the top suggestions. Maya adds a heart on the museum header and selects "I want to go!" (see sketch) to add the exhibitions to her Favorites for easy re-finding later.

## 3. Logging the visit (and review)
Maya visit the Institue of Contemporary Art and goes ott he exhibitions recommended by MuseMe. She is back in time to catch her flight. While waiting for the flight to board, she opens MuseMe, goes on the Browse tab, and searches "Institute of Contemporary Art" (see Browse subpage). She clicks on the museum card and the museum subpage pops up. This time, she selects "Log Visit" (see museum subpage sketch). This takes her to the review page (see Log Visit sketch). She tags the museum as LOVE by selecting the heart emoji. She keeps visibility Public (so friends can see she recommends this museum and the exhibits), and adds two exhibits (by checking the boxes) with 4–5★ plus a quick note and 5 photos. She taps Submit Visit.

## 4. Profile & lasting value
Back home, she is greeted by her roomate, Christina, and she wants to show her all the exhibits she visited, but she can't remember their names as she is tired from all the traveling. She opens Profile (see Profile sketch). Her new public visit appears under Recent Visits, and her stats show that she has visited 2 new exhibits. She clicks on her visit and shows Christina the photos and the names of the exhibits she saw. Next time she travels, Spotlight will use the recent LOVE tag and exhibit stars to sharpen recommendations.

## Outcome
Maya avoided decision fatigue, targeted a museum that matched her taste, and confidently chose exhibits—helped by one relatable social signal (Emma liked this”). She left with a clean diary entry and a saved favorite, and her future suggestions will be better aligned with what she actually enjoys.
