# Features

## Mental health routines

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Emotion analyzer** | After writing a diary entry, the app detects the dominant emotion (e.g., sadness, anxiety, joy) using emotion-token analysis from a pool of 5 emotions (happy, sad, neutral, angry, stressed). This gives users a clearer understanding of their feelings, which is key given that one of the biggest problems in psychology is actually understanding how you are feeling. Given how fast-paced everyday life is, users rarely stop and think about how they feel. This would also provide useful insights for therapists who treat such users. |
| **Art reflection** | The detected emotion is paired with a piece of art (painting, image, or design) that visually represents it. This might be beyond the scope of the class, but would be a great feature combining art and psychology. It would help users since it makes emotions more concrete and perceptible. Art would make users externalize and reflect on their mental state. It can also make self-care more engaging. Family and friends would benefit indirectly from that recognition and reflection on the user’s emotional state. Therapists could also gain useful insights from art therapy. |
| **Action to-do list** | Generates 2–3 tailored actions for the detected emotion (e.g., "Take a 10-minute walk" for stress; "Text a friend" for loneliness). This feature moves beyond reflection into practical coping, as well as empowering users to improve or maintain mood. This could be a good bridge between therapy sessions, as it would offer small actions. Also, this supports mental health professionals too, since it encourages healthy daily habits that they can then build on during therapy sessions. |


## Museum overwhelm

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Taste-based museum recommendations** | Users would rank museums they have visited with simple ratings ("Love," "Like," "Meh," "Skip"), building a personal taste profile. The app then recommends new museums nearby or in future travel destinations based on this profile. This would reduce the stress of choosing between dozens of cultural options. Visitors find museums more suited to their interests, and museums gain better-targeted visitors who are likely to enjoy and recommend them. |
| **Exhibit share** | After visiting an exhibit, users can quickly add a photo and tag it with their rating. This creates a visual diary of highlights and lets friends discover exhibits through trusted, authentic taste-sharing. It also acts as a digital diary for the user. Moreover, it makes recommendations personal and engaging, while followers can treat this like social media, by seeing what others genuinely enjoyed. More indirectly, museums benefit from organic word-of-mouth marketing through the picture sharing. |
| **“People like you” exhibit suggestions** | Beyond museum suggestion, this feature would use collaborative filtering to suggest exhibits based on ratings from other users with similar tastes. For instance, "people who loved the Impressionist gallery also loved this photography exhibit.” This feature would guide visitors toward hidden gems they might have missed, improving satisfaction and reducing “FOMO.” Concurrently, museums would benefit by distributing attention across more exhibits, not just the most famous pieces. This would improve flow in the museums, and help smaller artists gain attention. |


## Information overload

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adjustable news ‘bites’** | Each article can be skimmed in different lengths. For example, headline only, 30-second summary, 1-minute summary, or full read depending on how much time the reader has. This gives readers control over their time and attention, reducing overwhelm. It keeps people engaged instead of tuning out, which in turn benefits society by fostering informed citizens. News outlets might be opposed to this, since a lot of questions come up with AI summarization. Who is considered the author? Who gets credit? Will the writing be impacted and would authors still want to be associated with the re-written article? |
| **Shared highlights** | This feature allows readers to bookmark and share their top 1–2 daily stories with friends, which appear in a simple feed (like "What your friends are reading today"). This serves multiple purposes. First, it provides social proof and trusted recommendations, reducing choice fatigue. It also helps authors/journalists by having their work gain more exposure. Finally, friends and users can chat about the shared stories and engage in dialogue about what is going on around the world, hence benefiting society. |
| **Related media suggestions** | For each story, the app could recommend related podcasts, videos, or explainer threads so readers who want to go deeper can switch mediums and learn more. On one hand, this prevents readers from doomscrolling multiple outlets to get context. It also supports content creators by driving traffic to long-form, high-quality media while giving users a healthier way to engage. Having a number of different types of media to get information from will reduce fatigue and peak interest. |
