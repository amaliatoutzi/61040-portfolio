# Problems

## Personal healthcare management

| Problem | Selected | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Medication conflicts: people do not always know if two or more medicines or supplements might interact in harmful ways, unless a pharmacist advises them. | Not Selected | To provide reliable interaction warnings, an app would need access to medical databases and constantly updated pharmaceutical information, which are often restricted or behind paywalls. On top of that, it would require users to share highly sensitive personal healthcare data, raising major privacy and security concerns. Any mistakes in the information could have dangerous consequences, which places a level of responsibility and liability far beyond the scope of a student project like this one. |
| Mental health routines: people struggle to track and maintain small habits that support mental wellbeing (like journaling, mindfulness, or therapy homework). | Selected (FeelWrite or Balance) | Mental health has become more urgent since Covid-19, when many forms of medicine moved online but psychology did not adapt as well. I’ve taken psychology classes, and I think combining psychology with art could make a tool that feels supportive and creative rather than clinical. The goal wouldn’t be to replace psychologists but to complement them, helping people maintain small routines like journaling or mindfulness between sessions. Many people struggle quietly with mental health, so there is a real need for something approachable. While some apps that are similar exist, I believe there is room for a tool that feels different in the sense that it is more expressive and alternative (due to the combination with art). |
| Remembering routines: users forget to take medicines, vitamins, or supplements at the right times. | Not Selected | I don’t think there’s much differentiation in this sector. This problem can be solved by using alarms or just simple reminders on one’s phone, and most people who want a reminder can already find a straightforward solution. That makes it less interesting for a project, since it doesn’t offer as much room for creativity or originality compared to exploring medication conflicts or mental health support. |


## Travel prep and exploration

| Problem | Selected | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Packing stress: travelers either overpack or forget essentials, with no simple way to plan efficiently. | Not Selected | While it’s a common frustration, many people already rely on simple solutions like checklists, spreadsheets, or generic packing apps that already exist. These approaches may not be perfect, but in my experience, they get the job done. Compared to other travel challenges, packing feels more logistical than experiential, and, again, it doesn’t offer as much opportunity to design a creative or novel app. |
| Itinerary overload: trying to balance rest with sightseeing often leads to decision fatigue. | Not Selected | There are already several established tools, such as TripIt and Google Trips, that help travelers organize their schedules. While decision fatigue is real, many existing apps focus on balancing activities and time. Creating a new solution here would either risk duplicating what’s already available or require a very complex system to add real value. Additionally, I think this is covered by travel agents and it is challenging to create a personalized itinerary. |
| Museum overwhelm: large museums have too many exhibits, and visitors waste time or miss highlights. | Selected (MuseMe or Artinerary) | Museums are inspiring but often overwhelming, with hundreds of exhibits spread across large spaces. Most visitors don’t have the time or expertise to decide what to focus on, and generic maps or audio guides rarely adapt to personal interests. As a result, people often leave feeling like they missed highlights or wasted time. Also, people often go to touristy places and miss out on the true hidden gems, so this could not only help tourism, but also make a traveler’s experience better. This problem stood out to me because it’s both highly relatable and underexplored compared to packing or itinerary apps. Instead of spending time searching through lists or maps, visitors could swipe through exhibits, log what they enjoy, and get curated recommendations tailored to their “taste profile” or even based on where their friends have been. A solution like this could makes museums more approachable, and history fun again! |


## Reading the news

| Problem | Selected | Reason |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Information overload: news apps push dozens of articles on the same story, making it difficult to filter what’s essential versus repetitive, whilst newspapers are super long. | Selected (Smart Digest or Clear View) | It’s the most universal problem, so people will actually be interested in it. Almost anyone who reads the news today experiences it. Instead of feeling informed, people waste time scanning dozens of headlines that repeat the same points, and because of how fast-paced the world is, this is a waste of time. People are consistently bombarded with information and they do not end up retaining any of it. This problem stood out because it has authentic demand and room for a creative solution. In the context of this class, it feels more feasible and less technically complex than tackling bias detection or building a hyper-personalized recommender system. Additionally, I have a personal interest in it, especially as an international student who tries to stay informed on my local news but also on global news, and I often find myself really overwhelmed. |
| Bias and trust: readers struggle to evaluate whether a source is reliable, objective, or slanted, especially when different outlets frame the same story differently. | Not Selected | Admittedly, it would be very difficult to solve this problem within the scope of a lightweight app. Detecting bias or judging credibility would require advanced systems like fact-checking databases, credibility scoring, or perhaps even AI moderation. All of these are complex, and out of the scope of this class. Additionally, there are already organizations and tools working on this challenge, but, again, replicating or competing with them would go beyond what this project can realistically achieve. It would also raise questions about what is a trustworthy source, etc, which depend on the reader’s view. |
| Topic (ir)relevance: people want to follow specific topics (like local news, sports, or tech) but often end up scrolling through lots of unrelated stories to get to the ones they care about. | Not Selected | Many existing platforms already provide similar topic-based personalization, such as Google News and Apple News. Building something similar would risk duplicating what already exists and wouldn’t feel as creative or distinctive for this project. Additionally, it feels more like a feature of a solution, rather than an entire solution by itself, so perhaps it could be integrated with the first problem if I were to go with it. |
