# Assignment 1
# Project domains

## Overview
This document outlines ten possible domains for exploration in my project. The underlined domains are the ones I ended up choosing for further exploration.

## <u>1. Personal healthcare management</u>
### handling everyday health routines and medicines
My grandma has suffered from Parkinsons disease for the past 14 years and takes over 12 medications each day. I have noticed how complicated everyday health routines can get, both for me and for people I know. It is not just remembering to take a pill at the right time, but also keeping track of vitamins, prescriptions, and other habits like drinking enough water. Also, after the Covid-19 lockdown mental health has started gaining more attention. I am especially interested in the intersection of psychology and art, so focusing on mental health could connect directly to my interests.

## 2. <u>Travel prep and exploration</u>
### supporting people in preparing for trips, managing logistics, and making the most of cultural experiences
I really enjoy traveling, but I usually find the preparation and planning parts stressful, especially as a type A person. Packing is always a guessing game because of the weather in foreign countries, and I either bring too much or forget something important. I often just end up going to the most touristy places, but I feel like I am missing out on hidden gems. I find museums in particular to be overwhelming. I love learning about new cultures and history, so I always prioritize museums on my visits. People often find museums boring nowadays. I would like to make traveling feel lighter and more intentional, with tools that reduce decision fatigue and help me focus on the experiences I will genuinely enjoy.

## 3. Structured studying
### helping learners organize, connect, and review material more effectively.

## 4. Early-career relationships
### making it easy for young professionals to build and maintain professional connections.

## 5. Concerts and live events planning and memory
### enhancing the way people plan, attend, and share experiences at live events

## 6. Shopping and product discovery
### exploring items in a way that feels curated, simplified, and mall-like, whether online or in-person.

## 7. Social event planning
### small-group events (game nights, study groups, hangouts) and the friction around coordinating them.

## <u>8. Reading the news</u>
### navigating information overload in the news
I try to keep up with the news every day, usually through apps on my phone or scrolling headlines online. But it often feels overwhelming. It’s also hard to know which sources I can really trust, especially when articles have different spins on the same event. Sometimes I want deeper coverage of topics I care about, like tech or economics, but instead I get buried under endless feeds. Other times, I do not have much time, and I just want a quick glimpse into the topics I mostly care about. I’m interested in this domain because staying informed is important, but the way news is presented today makes it stressful, time-consuming, and confusing.

## 10. Neighborhood connections and community life
### rebuilding the sense of a friendly neighborhood by making it easier for people to connect, share resources, and support each other locally.
