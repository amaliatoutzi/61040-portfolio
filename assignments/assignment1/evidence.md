# Evidence

## Mental health routines

1. [**Social distancing increased emotional disorders**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9180779/): a narrative review confirms that COVID-19 social distancing is linked to rising rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and related outcomes. This demonstrates a clear rise in mental health challenges tied to isolation; hence, there is a clear need for accessible, emotional support tools.

2. [**Lockdowns sharply increased mental health service use**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55879-9?): In U.S. regions under lockdown, usage of mental health services increased by about 18%, compared to a 1% decline in non-lockdown areas. Emergency visits for panic and severe stress also rose. While this may show that there is a lot of competition in the sector, it also confirms that users are looking for such solutions to manage their emotions.

3. [**Prevalence of depression in U.S. adults rose to 12.4% post-pandemic**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-87593-5?): U.S. adult depression prevalence climbed to 12.4% post-pandemic, significantly higher than prior years. This statistic confirms long-lasting elevation in mental health issues, reinforcing need for self-care tools to support ongoing well-being.

4. [**Art therapy has a number of benefits**](https://crowncounseling.com/statistics/art-therapy-statistics/?): Art therapy can significantly reduce anxiety, depression, and stress by up to 73%; it improves self-esteem, resilience, and healing. This shows the importance of art in mental health. I do want to note though, that these benefits are delivered by in-person, guided art therapy sessions, but it offers a chance to move digitally.

5. [**COMPARABLE: Daylio**](https://daylio.net/): enables users to track moods and activities via quick entries, with insights through charts, patterns, and habit-building features. This app is a little similar as it focuses on self-tracked mood visibility. Nonetheless, it does not work with art or diaries and its insights are mostly charts and correlations, which are helpful for tracking, but not for active emotional support.

6. [**COMPARABLE: MoodKit**](https://www.cognitivebehaviorassociates.com/mental-health-app-reviews/?): it is an app that integrates a mood tracker, CBT-based journal, thought checker, and activity suggestions. Its overall goal is to help users monitor and improve emotional wellbeing using strategies grounded in psychology. While it is proven effective for tracking and reflection, it doesn't analyze text to recognize emotions, visualize feeling through art, or generate actionable to-do lists tailored to the user's current emotional state and it feels more clinical.

7. [**COMPARABLE: MoodGallery**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moodgallery-care-mental-health/id6745495394): an app that transforms your mood entries into personalized AI-generated artwork. It basically turns emotional states into visual expressions. This shares my idea’s goal of making emotions more perceptible through art, but it doesn't analyze text to determine emotion, nor does it offer definitions or actionable suggestions based on emotional state.

8. [**Writing for mood improvement (positive expressive writing)**](https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/health/free-and-easy-hack-can-help-you-be-happier-if-you-do-it-right/?): recent UK research in PLOS One reviewed 51 studies (1930-2023) and found that just 15 minutes a day of "positive expressive writing" (grateful or forward-looking entries) significantly lowers distress and boosts mood. This study validates that brief journaling positively impacts emotional well-being which is in line with my idea.

9. [**Journaling enhances emotional awareness and stress reduction**](https://www.columbiapsychiatry-dc.com/counseling-blog/benefits-of-journaling-for-your-mental-health/?): according to Columbia Mental Health (2025), regular journaling reduces stress and anxiety, improves emotional awareness and mood, and increases self-compassion. Similar to the previous piece of evidence this reinforces that writing-based tools can nurture self-awareness and emotional regulation.

10. [**High self-reported mental health benefits in students**](https://www.uwlax.edu/globalassets/offices-services/urc/jur-online/pdf/2021/koziol.callie.eng.pdf?): in a university study, 94.8% of students who journaled reported finding it at least somewhat beneficial to their mental health, and found it enjoyable. While I do not target a specific age group, I do anticipate that my idea will be more for young adults as they are more open to alternative technological tools, and they are also impacted strongly by Covid-19. Given that, this study shows a strong positive response among young adults for journaling habits. This could potentially mirror my idea’s engagement.


## Museum overwhelm

1. [**Engagement drops after 30 minutes**](https://www.cntravellerme.com/story/experts-reveal-the-surprising-reason-museums-and-galleries-make-you-feel-so-tired?): A 2019 study published in *Visitor Studies* found that museum-goers’ engagement and comprehension decline sharply after about 30 minutes in an exhibition space. This shows that attention and satisfaction decrease mid-visit, supporting the idea that visitors need help focusing on key exhibits to avoid overwhelm.

2. [**Museum fatigue is a recognized phenomenon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_fatigue?): “Museum fatigue” is defined as physical or mental fatigue triggered by overwhelming exhibits. The term dates back to 1916 and has been confirmed in later experiments showing attention decline over time. This fact confirms museum fatigue is not anecdotal. In fact, it’s a well-documented, historically validated issue that museums and researchers have studied for over a century.

3. [**Travelers spend excessive time planning**](https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/27368710/brits-waste-hours-planning-holiday-loveholidays/?): A survey of 2,000 UK holidaymakers found travelers spend over 1 hour per day planning during trips, totaling 17 hours across two weeks. 29% reported feeling overwhelmed by choices, including cultural activities like museum visits. This fact demonstrates that trip planning is stressful and time-consuming. A solution like the one I propose could help address this.

4. [**Fear of missing out intensifies stress**](https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/27368710/brits-waste-hours-planning-holiday-loveholidays/?): 84% of travelers worry they’ll make the wrong choice and miss out on “must-do” activities. This statistic shows how indecision and FOMO can amplify planning fatigue. Using recommendations could help visitors make more informed decisions about where to go.

5. [**Decision-making model for leisure choices**](https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lessons-learned-from-five-decades-of-experience-in-visitor-studies.pdf?): Falk and Dierking’s visitor studies show people weigh benefits vs. costs when making leisure decisions, including museum visits. If the perceived value doesn’t outweigh the time and effort, people often skip or overanalyze. This study explains why planning decisions can lead to “analysis paralysis” without curated support.

6. [**Real-world indecision on travel forums**](https://community.ricksteves.com/travel-forum/netherlands-reviews/going-to-amsterdam-and-have-only-three-full-days-there-want-to-know-which-museum-to-go-visit?): On Rick Steves and Reddit travel forums, visitors often debate which museums to prioritize (e.g., Van Gogh Museum vs Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam), showing how difficult choices erode trip quality. It confirms people indeed struggle with choosing a museum to visit.

7. [**COMPARABLE: Explorer (AMNH app)**](https://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit/explorer?): Offers exhibit recommendations based on pre-selected interests and sorts them by proximity in the museum. While it provides personalization, it’s static and doesn’t evolve from real-time user feedback, nor does it involve user’s friends. It also doesn’t apply to museum selection as a whole but rather exhibit selection.

8. [**COMPARABLE: Smartify**](https://smartify.org/?): lets users scan artworks to get information, save favorites, and curate collections (people call it “Shazam for art.”) On one hand, it enhances access to art information, but it lacks taste-driven recommendations or exhibit-level ratings.

9. [**COMPARABLE: Artmatcher**](https://www.artmatcher.com/): uses a swipe interface to help users build a taste profile and recommends artworks and events accordingly. This is closer to the solution I propose since it has some personalization, but it isn’t really focusing on museum visits or exhibit selection.

10. [**Attention-value model**](https://www.academia.edu/9159214/An_Attention_Value_Model_of_Museum_visitors?): Bitgood’s model shows attention declines as exhibit density increases, driven by saturation and overload. This paper provides theoretical backing that exhibit overload leads directly to declining engagement. My solution aims to mitigate this issue.


## Information overload

1. [**Many people avoid the news due to anxiety and overload**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety?): a Reuters Institute survey (covered in *The Guardian*, 2025) found that 40% of respondents worldwide sometimes or often avoid the news, up from 29% in 2017. In the U.S. and U.K., the rates are 42% and 46%, respectively. The primary reasons cited include negative mood impacts, overexposure to war/conflict coverage, and feelings of helplessness. This confirms that news overwhelm is widespread, so there is indeed a need for my idea.

2. [**Media fatigue is a well-recognized psychological issue**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_fatigue?): "Media fatigue" refers to mental exhaustion from overwhelming information consumption (news and social media), leading to stress, emotional instability, and avoidance. Similar to museum fatigue, this confirms that the issue is a formalized, multi-dimensional challenge, so a solution could be meaningful on a number of levels.

3. [**Doomscrolling significantly damages mental and physical health**](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/doomscrolling-makes-you-12-times-more-likely-to-suffer-serious-mental-health-issues/news-story/521275d020a2a3ca1e4bf980fe4b9c14?): excessive doomscrolling, particularly before bedtime may raise the risk of insomnia by 59%, and people who engage often are 12 times more likely to face serious mental health issues. While doomscrolling isn’t a direct issue, it relates to information overload. A solution that allows you to edit the length of articles could be crucial in addressing this.

4. [**Digital overload disrupts focus, sleep, and mood**](https://mypacifichealth.com/media-consumption-mental-health-effects/?): similarly, continuous streams of news, social media, and alerts contribute to anxiety, disrupted sleep, reduced concentration, and burnout, often without full awareness. Once again, this confirms that the problem is not just too much content, but more specifically, overstimulation that affects well-being.

5. [**COMPARABLE: Daily News (AI Summarization Tool)**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daily-news-ai-summarization/id6504045284): this is an app that filters clickbait, and generates AI summaries, while adapting to user interests. While it offers summary and filtering, it lacks dynamic controls for article length or format based on reading time, and there is no recommendation of podcasts or other related media.

6. [**COMPARABLE: Human-AI News Reader (Marvista tool)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08401?): while not a concrete app, Marvista supports planning what to read based on time and interest, guiding comprehension with AI-generated prompts and summaries. Still, this is a research prototype and again does not have a multi-length control approach or media integration. I do want to highlight it, though, as it offers unique features.

7. [**COMPARABLE: LetMeKnow**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=com.diemz.letmeknow&): it is an app that aggregates local, national, and global news from 3,000+ sources and clusters stories to avoid repetition. It also uses AI to generate concise summaries, while providing personalized news feeds. It tackles repetitive content and clutter with AI summaries and clustering, similar to my approach, but it lacks flexible article-length control. What is cool about it is you can select the news outlets you want to get information from, so that it is more targeted to what you enjoy. On the other hand, this could perpetuate the bias you might already have.

8. [**66% (2019) felt worn out by news volume**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10497396/?): Pew Research reported that 66% of people felt "worn out" by the volume of news (especially political), up from 59% in 2016. This underlines that it is not just the content, but also the volume and the toll is not only technological, but also emotional. Thus, the proposed solution could help alleviate that mental toll.

9. [**Importance of news consumption for active citizenship**](https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2025/sep/01/news-avoidance-high-anxiety?): As many citizens are tuned out due to overload, analysts warn that total disengagement from news may deepen social divides and reduce political participation, especially among young people, women, and lower socio-economic groups. This evidence shows that disengagement from the news is a bad thing as it harms civic cohesion. My proposed solution could help people remain engaged with news (in moderation), and, thus, be more active and informed citizens.

10. [**People spend different amounts of time reading news**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/segr89/how_much_time_in_a_day_do_you_spend_reading_the/): In a Reddit *r/AskMen* thread about how much time men spend reading the news, some users reported dedicating 1–2 hours daily to following local and international news in multiple languages, while others noted spending only 15 minutes skimming headlines or comic strips. This shows that news consumption habits vary widely across individuals. While some prefer deep, time-intensive reading, others opt for quick, surface-level scans. Hence, it highlights the need for a solution that lets users adjust article length and depth based on the time they have available.
